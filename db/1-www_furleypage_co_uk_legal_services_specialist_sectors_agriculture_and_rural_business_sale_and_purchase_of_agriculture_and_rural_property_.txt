Often it also involves the purchase or sale of a business or part of one. What about stock and crops; agricultural support payments and similar; planning and employment issues? Should the purchase be by an individual or a partnership or company?
The answers to these questions can have long term tax and other consequences for the buyer and his or her family, you must get it right first time. You should seek legal advice from specialists with agricultural and rural experience. Agriculture and rural business services Agriculture and rural business Sale and purchase of agriculture and rural property Agriculture tenancies Joint venture development projects Sporting rights over rural property Wills for farmers and business owners Legal transfer, tax and succession
Not only can we carry out the technical business of organising the legal transfer of ownership on the terms you (or your agent) will have negotiated, but we can – maybe with your accountant and land agent – ask and then deal with the “what if?” and “how should it be structured?” questions.
Certainly in relation to tax you don’t often get a second chance if you get it wrong first time. Working with our tax and succession planners we can often suggest structural arrangements which produce the best solution for now and for the future.
