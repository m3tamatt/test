Our registered office is at 39 St Margaret’s Street, Canterbury, Kent, CT1 2TX.
A limited liability partnership is a body corporate which has “members”. However, it is more usual for senior professionals to be referred to as “partners”. The members of the LLP have decided to retain the traditional title of “partner”. There is, however, no partnership between the members or between the members and the LLP. A reference on this website or otherwise in the course of your dealings with the LLP, to a person being a “partner”, is a reference to that person in his or her capacity as a member of the LLP. References to “firm”, “we”, “us” or “our” are references to the LLP.
Any advice given to (or other work done for) you by a member, employee or consultant of the LLP is given (or done) by that person on behalf of the LLP and not in his or her individual capacity and no such person assumes any personal responsibility to you for the advice or other work.
You can inspect a list of the names of the members of the LLP at our registered office address during normal business hours or find such details at Companies House.
We are authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.
