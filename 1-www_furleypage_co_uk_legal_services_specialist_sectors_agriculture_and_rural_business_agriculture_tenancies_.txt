Part of the management and reorganisation can – particularly for a long running tenancy – involve assignment or transfer of the tenant’s interest.
Before 1996 there was one statutory tenancy regime; since 1995 there has been a completely different one. (And there are plenty of “old” regime tenancies still about.)
If you are involved at any stage of either regime we can help you.

Furley Page has been advising agricultural landlords and tenants for over 200 years. Our extensive history in advising both agricultural landlords and tenants means that we can look at a problem or issue from both sides.
This is of major benefit if you are looking to achieve the best reasonable and cost effective solution, whether it is to a major reorganisation exercise, like changing from an old tenancy to a new one to secure an extra 50% inheritance tax saving on the value of the farm; or a matter of detail, like should it be the landlord or the tenant who has sporting rights over the land.
We know that unless the tenancy is just about to end, continuing good relations between landlord and tenant may be just as valuable as achievement of every single item on a “shopping list” of points in a complicated negotiation.
