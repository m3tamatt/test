Mishandling an issue can have serious consequences to an establishment’s finances and reputation.
We have many years of experience of giving advice to educational establishments on issues that are legally, commercially and financially sensitive.
Broadly speaking, such communications are covered by legal advice privilege and are therefore exempt from disclosure requirements. Education services Education Employment advice for the education sector Legal advice privilege only extends to legal advice given by a member of the legal profession which includes qualified solicitors.
If you receive legal advice from a human resources consultant who is not legally qualified, or from an advisory service that does not employ any legally qualified staff, legal advice privilege will not apply to those communications.
Having to disclose those communications to the other party in any Court or Tribunal proceedings could have a dire effect on your bargaining strength in negotiations and on your prospects of success.
