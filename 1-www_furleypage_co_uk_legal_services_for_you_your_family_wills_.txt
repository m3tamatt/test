Making a will and keeping it up-to-date is the best way to make sure your assets are distributed according to your wishes when you die.
Without a will, the rules of intestacy will apply and you will have no choice in who the beneficiaries of your estate will be. This can cause unnecessary friction at an emotional time for your family.
