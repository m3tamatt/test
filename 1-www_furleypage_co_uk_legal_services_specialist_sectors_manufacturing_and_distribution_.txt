From funding new development and manufacture, to protecting your brand and intellectual property rights. Working with suppliers to source raw materials, or to make components for your goods – potentially using tooling belonging to you or your customer.
And finally making sure the goods are made to meet specification and quality and are also packaged properly. All this happens before you get the goods to the market. You may sell directly or through distributors or agents or both and have to deal with the logistics behind the supply.
It is easy to inadvertently damage your revenue stream and increase your risk and liability if you don’t get proper legal advice.
