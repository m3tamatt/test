We all know the NHS does an excellent job in the face of difficult financial restraints, but sometimes mistakes do happen.
Given the type of service that healthcare professionals provide, both through the NHS and privately, when mistakes are made they can have potentially damaging consequences for a patient.
We understand the concerns an injury can cause, which is why we offer a free investigation into your medical or clinical negligence injury claim. Criteria for medical and clinical negligence claims
The law accepts that, with a few rare exceptions, medical practitioners have trained in medicine to help people and they do not set out with the intention to cause their patients any harm.
In order to be successful in medical or clinical negligence claim the Claimant must prove two things:- The care or treatment that they received fell below the standard that would be expected from a reasonably competent practitioner and
that the negligent care or treatment caused them to suffer an adverse outcome. In other words, an outcome that is worse than it would have been had they received appropriate, non-negligent treatment. What is the difference between medical and clinical negligence?
Medical negligence refers to both clinical and research activities within medicine and includes non-surgical treatments. Clinical negligence refers to actually diagnosing and treating patients.
