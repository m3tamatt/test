The Legal 500 2021 - Agriculture As well as for the sale of agricultural land I have used Furley Page for the purchase of a house. Being fairly new to both of these ventures I found them knowledgeable and competent in their fields and keen to help and guide me. The Legal 500 2021 - Agriculture & house purchase Based on my experience of the practice, Furley Page has a good understanding of the sector and similar farming businesses. This quickly allows a trusting relationship to develop. The team members are knowledgeable, personable, efficient, and I enjoy working with them. The Legal 500 2021 - Agriculture more team feedback Having used competitors in Kent before we can confirm Furley Page are a few steps above the others in our experience. We would highly recommend Furley Page. The Legal 500 2021 - Agriculture team feedback All have been professional in their work and, just as important, human in their care, consideration and help outside the legal matter being considered.
